Experimenting new things on my old championship platform.

## DDD but not too much
I'm experimenting an DDD approach, but, instead of using Entities isolated from Infra/Application layer.
The idea is to use Eloquent without write operations.
This way, we can use the features from Eloquent without having to reinvent the wheel.

This will use the benefits from Eloquent and DDD at once.
